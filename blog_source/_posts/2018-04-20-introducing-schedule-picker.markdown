# Never have to remember cron syntax again with our new Schedule Picker

We recently revamped our schedule picking. After lots of feedback from users, we decided to simplify how you pick a schedule for your cron job. Originally we used the linux cron syntax (and we still do in the backend) but we've decided to simplify it from a user perspective. Check it out below.

I'm sure you'll agree it's much nicer than having to Google what "every day at 10am" is in cron syntax or even using our handy [cron builder](https://www.cronasaservice.com/cron-builder/).

If you haven't signed up for an account yet, now is the time. We're working really hard on bringing great new features to you as soon as possible.
