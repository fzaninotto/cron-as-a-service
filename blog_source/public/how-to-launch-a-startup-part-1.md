###Lecture by Sam Altman from YCombinator

Starting your own Startup is a daunting but exciting task. Luckily, there are plenty of people before you who've done it all and build **billion dollar** businesses in the process. Sam Altman is one of those guys, he quit college to start his own company and then launched YCombinator, one of the worlds best known accelerators of the back of it.

Sam recently taught a course at *Stanford University* on launching a Startup. It's fantastic viewing and we thoroughly recommend it. We've learnt so much from Sam and over the next few blog posts we hope you will too.
