#Introducing Cron Alarms

We just launched a brand new feature, [cron alarms](https://www.cronasaservice.com/) and they are pretty freaking awesome.

##Free cron monitoring, all thanks to you.

We get some great feedback here at [cronasaservice.com](https://www.cronasaservice.com/), several users have asked us to add an alarm feature to monitor their jobs. Well here it is, we will email you when the http request from your cron job doesn't return the status code you expect. If you are feeling really awesome, you can set up an alarm to parse a JSON response looking for a value (using jsonPath).

Alarms are so simple to add to your existing cron jobs, just check out the demo below.
